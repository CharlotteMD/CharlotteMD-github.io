              <h2>About Me</h2>

              <p>After taking some courses online and attending tech meetups, studying Web Development full-time seemed like the obvious next step. I see my decision to study at General Assembly as an investment in myself and my future. I’ve been searching for the thing that makes me look forward to going into work everyday, and the more I code, the more it feels like development is that thing. It utilises a lot of the skills that I have developed so far in my career: logic, intellectual curiosity, creativity and business acumen, and ultimately commitment to hard work. I am naturally ambitious and driven and the small but frequent wins from debugging and passing tests really motivate my continued success.</p>
              <br>
              <p>I’m really excited that the skills I have learnt are already allowing me to build my ideas into something physical. I am buzzing with ideas for my next side project and would value working for an organisation that encourages innovation and creativity.  I aspire to work in an organisation who sees my potential and are willing to continue to develop me, so that over time, I can continue to contribute to the organisation.</p>

                  <p>In week 6 of WDI, I created my first full-stack app, an interactive guest book for weddings. Privacy was important in this project as I only wanted guests who were attending that wedding to be able to view the guestbook. Each GuestBook has a randomly generated code which can be distributed to guests offline. The page filters what guests can see based on whether they are attending the wedding, or if they are the owner of the book.</p>

                  <p>APPrès is a ski holiday planning app. Working in a team of 3 to complete this project was a personal highlight of WDI! I learnt a lot from my peers in terms of ways of working, design and we all supported each other with the trickier parts of our code. With more brains on the job, we had more time to develop the functionality of the app, and personally I learnt to use Google APIs and a little about test driven development.</p>

                  <p>GetARoom is an auction site for hotel rooms. The auction functionality turned out to be pretty complicated to build! I needed to show the user whether their bid was higher than the reserve price and the highest in the array of all bids made, and if it was, to save it to the array. React is my favourite language learnt on WDI - I find it very logical.  I also really loved writing tests for this project.</p>
